# Node IVR Sample Apps

FreeClimbâ€™s Interactive Voice Response (IVR) feature allows for automated interactions between FreeClimb and the caller where the caller responds with voice and/or [DTMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling) (e.g. keyapd) inputs. Read our [Building an IVR](https://docs.freeclimb.com/docs/building-an-ivr) guide for more information. 

This repo offers five variations of an IVR application: 
- [Call routing: DTMF](call-router-1.0)
- [Call routing: Voice-enabled DTMF](call-router-2.0)
- [Self-service 1.0](self-service-1.0)
- [Self-service 1.5](self-service-1.5)
- [Self-service 2.0](self-service-2.0)
