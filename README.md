# Node IVR Sample Apps

FreeClimbâ€™s Interactive Voice Response (IVR) feature allows for automated interactions between FreeClimb and the caller where the caller responds with voice and/or keypad inputs (aka DTMF). Read our [Building an IVR](https://docs.freeclimb.com/docs/building-an-ivr) guide for more information. 

This repo offers five variations of an IVR application: 
- [Call routing 1.0: DTMF](call-router-1.0)
- [Call routing 2.0: DTMF and voice-enabled](call-router-2.0)
- Self-service 1.0 (coming soon)
- Self-service 1.5 (coming soon)
- Self-service 2.0 (coming soon)

## Tutorial
We offer an [Interactive Voice Response (IVR) tutorial](https://docs.freeclimb.com/docs/ivr-call-routing-10) for more detailed set-up instructions and explanation of how the code in each IVR sample app variation works.
